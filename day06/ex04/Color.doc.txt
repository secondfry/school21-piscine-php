<- Color ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Color class handles RGB colors.

An instance can be contructed from either a RGB value:
new Color( array( 'rgb' => 255 << 16 + 255 << 8 + 255 ) );

Or from distinct red, green, blue constitutives:
new Color( array( 'red' => 255, 'green' => 255, 'blue' => 255 ) );

Range for red, green, blue constitutives is from 0 to 255.
Range for RGB values is from 0 to 255 << 16 + 255 << 8 + 255.
They are first converted to integers and then cropped to fit in range.
Any other use is undefined behaviour.

The class provides the following methods :

Color   add( Color $other );
Adds each color constitutive and returns a new Color instance.

Color   sub( Color $other );
Substracts each color constitutive and returns a new Color instance.

Color   mult( mixed $f );
Multiplies each color constitutive by factor $f converted to float and
returns a new Color instance.

Color   setRBG( array['rgb' => value] );
Sets red, green and blue constitutives.
Range for RGB values is from 0 to 255 << 16 + 255 << 8 + 255.

Color   set( array['red'? => value, 'green'? => value, 'blue'? => value ]);
Allows partial color (i.e. only red and green channel supplied).
Sets red, green and blue constitutives.
Range for red, green, blue constitutives is from 0 to 255.

Color   setRed( int $red );
Sets red constitutive.
Range for red constitutive is from 0 to 255.

Color   setGreen( int $green );
Sets green constitutive.
Range for green constitutive is from 0 to 255.

Color   setBlue( int $blue );
Sets blue constitutive.
Range for blue constitutive is from 0 to 255.
